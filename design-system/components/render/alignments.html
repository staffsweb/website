<h2>Alignments</h2>

<p>Elements can be aligned left and right within the normal flow of paragraph content using the classes <code>align-left</code> and <code>align-right</code>. Where no specific size is selected, they'll default to <strong>size-md at small screens, and size-sm at larger screens</strong>
  width. This is normally fine.</p>
<p>As these elements are floated, <strong>always make sure there is enough copy to flow all the way around the element to 'clear' it.</strong>

<h2>Sizes</h2>

<p>Elements can be given a size to restrict their width. Normally <strong>you don't need to</strong>, by default things will be size-md at small screens, and size-sm at larger screens, but if you want to make something explicitly larger or
  smaller than its default width <strong>at all times</strong>, add one of:</p>

<ul class="list--unstyled  list--inline">
  <li><code>align-size-xs</code></li>
  <li><code>align-size-sm</code></li>
  <li><code>align-size-md</code></li>
  <li><code>align-size-lg</code></li>
</ul>

<p>It's normally a good idea to delay adding a heading until you've added enough copy to clear a left-aligned figure, else it can look weird.</p>
