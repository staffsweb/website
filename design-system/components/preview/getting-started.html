    <p class="intro">The component library contains some guidance on what components are for and how to use them
      from both a content editor, and developer viewpoint on each individual component. There are also some more
      globally applicable guidelines for things like Typography, Colour, Spacing and Layout on other pages in this
      section.</p>
    <p class="intro"><strong>This is mostly technical documentation intended for those using and maintaining the
        Staffs component library. If you don't write code, this might not be the page you're looking for, skip

      <h2>Fractal</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The component library is managed using <a href="https://fractal.build">Fractal</a>, which has great documentation
  worth familiarising yourself with, it's already set up to run in the repo, you'll just need it installed on your
  system, see: <a href="https://fractal.build/guide/installation.html#installing-the-fractal-cli-tool">Installing the
    Fractal CLI tool</a></p>
<p>The <code>package.json</code> file in the root of the repository should list everything you need to run the project
  locally. Just run:</p>

<pre>npm install</pre>

<p>to grab the packages, then to check everything is working, you should be able to run:

<pre>fractal start</pre>

<p>To get a viewable localhost version running on your system at this point. You can kill the process after you confirm it's
  working.</p>

<p>Fractal's settings can be found in <code>fractal.config.js</code> in the root, as per <a
      href="https://fractal.build/guide/project-settings.html">the docs</a>. Changing anything in this file will
  need a restart of Fractal to take effect.</p>

<p>In the long term, we'll run Fractal through <a href="https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start">Gulp</a>,
  more on this later.</p>


<div class="section-header  section-header--bg-offwhite align-full  margin-top-6xl" id="file-structure">
  <div class="wrap">
    <div class="section-header__title  title">
      <h2>File structure</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The file structure for Fractal is set in <code>fractal.js</code> for components, assets, docs and the build folder.
</p>
<p>The docs folder is unused, we have a folder in components (<code>src/components/01-globals-and-docs</code>) for these
  docs (yes, these ones you're reading now), as it's a bit easier to add fancier styles and examples here.</p>

<h3 class="h4">The Build Folder</h3>
<p>The <code>design-system</code> folder is the <strong>build folder</strong>. This contains <strong>generated code and
    should not be edited</strong>. It will be overwritten when building a static version of the component library.
  More on this later.</p>

<h3 class="h4">The Source Folder</h3>
<p><code>src</code> contains everything you'll edit. It runs the localhost version while you're building things, and is
  then compiled when <a href="https://fractal.build/guide/web/exporting-static-html.html#configuration">exporting a
    static HTML version</a>.

<h3 class="h4">Templating Note</h3>
<p>You'll notice that all the template files use <a href="https://twig.symfony.com">Twig</a> as a <a
      href="https://fractal.build/guide/customisation/template-engines.html">templating language</a>. This means
  components can be built to be directly included in Drupal and WordPress (using <a
      href="https://github.com/timber/timber">Timber</a> or likewise). While that might not be directly
  appropriate for your project's integration, it sped up the development of components at the time ðŸ˜‡.</p>
<p><strong>Plain ol' HTML is valid Twig, and the compiled HTML can be viewed for all components from within Fractal in
  the HTML tab along the bottom of the screen</strong>.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Global Assets</h3>
<p>Assets like fonts, images, js and styles (in <a href="https://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>) are stored in
  <code>src/assets</code>. Edit them here, they get copied to the build folder when building a static version of the
  component library.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Components</h3>
<p>Each component has a folder in <code>src/components/</code>. This normally contains a <code>.twig</code> view
  template (for the HTML), some contain a config file to add context, dynamically created variants, control naming and
  ordering. Ideally all the styles and JS for a component will live here also. At the time of writing, all the
  components have their own <code>.scss</code> file for styles, but the JS is in one <code>app.js</code> file in
  <code>assets</code>.</p>
<p>The JavaScript could probably use breaking up and bundling better. Ideally it'd be nice to do a similar thing with JS
  for each component as we do for Sass styles, so:</p>

<pre>
â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ slider
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ slider.twig
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ slider--variant.twig
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ slider.config.yml
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _sliders.scss
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ _sliders.js
</pre>

    <div class="section-header__title  title">
      <h2>Build process / Code compilation (Gulp)</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="intro">The build process has been set up using <a
      href="https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start">Gulp</a> for simplicity, cross-platform
  compatibility, and extensibility. It probably has some room for improvement, but it 'just works' for now ðŸ˜¬. If
  improved, remember to update these docs.</p>

<p>
  <del>We used to use a 'designer-friendly' GUI app for code compilation, set up for use with <a
        href="https://codekitapp.com">CodeKit</a> which sadly is a <strong>Mac only</strong> app. A suitable
    cross-platform GUI alternative might be <a href="https://prepros.io">PrePros</a>.
  </del>
</p>

<p>If you've never used Gulp on your system, <a href="https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start/#install-the-gulp-command-line-utility">install the CLI</a> with:</p>

<pre>npm install --global gulp-cli</pre>


<p>Our goal for a build process, among other things is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sass to CSS compilation</li>
  <li>Sass syntax checking</li>
  <li>Compact output style, works best for git diffs, but compressed (minified) is an option</li>
  <li>Source maps</li>
  <li>PostCSS/Autoprefixer</li>
  <li>Theme image optimisation (for SVG, JPEG, PNG, etc.)</li>
  <li>JavaScript transpilation (Babel)</li>
  <li>ESLint syntax checking</li>
  <li>JS minification if not taken care of by the CMS</li>
  <li>JS source maps</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a gulpfile in the root where a basic command-line build process for Sass/JS has been set up.</p>

<p>The build process watches Sass/JS and compiles on the fly, and also runs the equivelant of <code>fractal start</code>
  to running a localhost with BrowserSync. This is the default gulp task, so you just need to run:</p>

<pre>gulp</pre>

<p>A <code>gulp build</code> task has been set up, which currently just runs <code>fractal build</code>, but could be extended.</p>
<p>There's also a <code>gulp deploy</code> task, which in future could be modified to generate minified assets if needed for the target environment.</p>


<h3 class="h4">Sass (to CSS)</h3>

<p>Global styles are located in <code>src/assets/styles/</code>.</p>

<p>The entry point / manifest for generation of the main CSS is in <code>src/assets/styles/main.scss</code></p>

<ul>
  <li><code>__vars</code> is used for variables/settings, nothing in this folder outputs code, it's just variables and
    mixins to be called from other places. <strong>Change things here, and they'll likely cascade across the site
      (and subthemes).</strong></li>
  <li><code>_global</code> contains global, non-componentized styles required for everything, like base typography,
    layout wrappers
  </li>
  <li><code>_grid</code> contains the code that actually outputs the grid system, it doesn't need to be edited unless
    you want to for example, significantly rename classes or upgrade it to use flexbox rather than floats. You can
    <em>extend</em> the grid system by editing its settings <code>_grid.scss</code> <strong> in
      <code>__vars</code></strong>.
  </li>
  <li><code>_utils</code> contains code which outputs utility classes</li>
  <li><code>_vendor</code> is a place to add third-party styles if they can't be enqueued in another way. We mostly
    just use this to include <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Normalize</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Component styles</strong> are separated out into their component folders, and are included by main.scss. It
  'reaches out' of the assets folder and into each component, for example:</p>

<pre>
@import "__vars/_all";
@import "../../components/card/cards";
</pre>

<p><strong>NB: We do not (currently) use 'globbing' to include all files (such as components) - eg. <code>@import
      "../../components/*/*";</code></strong>. Partially as some Sass compilers don't support it for 'reasons',
  and partially to control the ordering of what gets imported (one of the 'reasons' some Sass compilers opt not to
  support globbing). Thus, with the current build process, when you add a partial, you'll need to <strong>manually
    (purposefully) add it to <code>main.scss</code> (and any other subthemes created)</strong>. More on this in the
  guide below.</p>


<h3 class="h4">JavaScript</h3>

<p>Our first rule is to use sparingly. If a JavaScript-free solution is available (like <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details">&lt;details&gt;</a>),
  prefer it!</p>
<p>That said, it's mad to think we can eliminate JavaScript completely.</p>
<p>JavaScript lives in <code>src/assets/js</code> and is processed by gulp.</p>
<p>The entry point is <code>app.js</code>, which currently uses


  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-include">gulp-include</a> syntax to bring in third-party
  libraries we keep in <code>src/assets/js/vendor/</code>. Using "proper" package management for this would be a
  great idea.
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it'd also be really nice to separate out what are currently three functions for the megaNav, tabs
  and slider into separate files in their component folders, and bundle them 'properly' using modern JavaScript
  methods.</p>
<p>It ain't perfect, but it Works For Now&trade;.</p>

<p>The result of <code>gulp default</code> is output at <code>src/assets/dev/js</code>, which is referenced in Fractal's localhost, and copied to the build folder when building.</p>
<p>There's a <code>src/assets/dist</code> folder which would be used by <code>gulp deploy</code> to create minified assets, but this is currently not in use. If the target CMS environment doesn't
  support concatenation and minification of CSS/JS, this is worth looking into for performance.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<ol>
  <li>From command line, run
    <pre>gulp</pre>
    from the root of the project, this should start Fractal, Sass/JS filewatching, and open your browser to the localhost.
  </li>
  <li>Create a folder for the component in <code>src/components/</code>, eg.
    <code>src/components/your-component/</code></li>
  <li>Create a <code>.twig</code> template file (for the HTML) inside the folder, .eg <code>src/components/your-component/your-component.twig</code>
    - as soon as you do this, Fractal should refresh and the component should appear in the components list on the
    left
  </li>
  <li>Create a <code>.scss</code> 'partial' file prefixed with an underscore (this lets the compiler know not to
    directly compile the file, because it is included by another file), eg. <code>src/components/your-component/_your-component.scss</code>
  </li>
  <li>Reference the partial <code>.scss</code> in <code>src/assets/styles/main.scss</code>*, so that it's brought into
    the site CSS, by adding a line like so:
    <pre>@import "../../components/your-component/your-component";</pre>
    For now, this will be compiled to <code>src/assets/styles/main.css</code>, which is referenced in Fractal.
  </li>
  <li>Write the HTML and Sass for your component</li>
  <li>When you're done, <a href="https://fractal.build/guide/web/exporting-static-html.html#configuration">run a build to a static HTML version</a> by running
    <pre>gulp build</pre>
    (or fractal build) from the command line. This will compile .twig to static HTML, and copy all (already compilied on-the-fly) assets (fonts/img/css/js) to the <code>design-system</code>
    folder, so the component library can be viewed without having to run a localhost version
  </li>
  <li>Add the new/modified files to your chosen flavour of source control</li>
  <li>Repeat!</li>
</ol>

<p><sup>* this will add the component to the main site styles, to include in sub-themes, add to their Sass file too, eg.
    <code>main-ldn.scss</code></sup></p>
