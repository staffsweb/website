The <code>.megaNav__topLevel-item</code> can have a class of <code>is-active</code> to apply its 'active' state (top red border)

For items with no third level, a class of <code>has-simple-children</code> should be added to the <code>megaNav__topLevel-item</code> (in addition to <code>has-children</code>)
